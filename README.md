## 🧪 Testing

We maintain comprehensive test coverage with unit tests and integration tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Coverage

Current coverage: **100% statements, 100% branches**

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for detailed testing documentation.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Production Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to Render on pushes to `main` branch.

**Live URL**: [StarMock on Render](https://starmock.onrender.com)

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment documentation.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Workflows

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

#### Quality Gates (Parallel Execution)
- **🎨 Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier checks
- **🧪 Unit Tests**: Vitest test suite
- **🔒 Security Audit**: npm audit for vulnerabilities

#### Build & Deploy
- **🏗️ Build**: Production build with timing metrics
- **🚀 Deploy**: Automatic deployment to Render
- **🏥 Health Check**: Smart retry verification with exponential backoff

#### Additional Checks
- **📊 Coverage**: Test coverage reporting
- **🔍 CodeQL**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **📦 Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **✅ PR Checks**: Title format, size validation

### Workflow Performance

- **Parallel Execution**: Quality checks run simultaneously
- **50% Faster**: Optimized pre-deploy phase
- **Smart Caching**: npm dependencies cached for speed

See [.github/workflows/README.md](./.github/workflows/README.md) for workflow documentation.
